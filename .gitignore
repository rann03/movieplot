# Data files managed by DVC (DVC tracks them, Git tracks the .dvc files)
# This tells Git to ignore the actual data files if DVC is managing them.
# Be careful with broad patterns if some data in these dirs ISN'T DVC-managed and SHOULD be in Git.

# If all files in 'data/ingested/' are DVC managed, you could do:
# data/ingested/*
# !data/ingested/*.dvc # Keep the .dvc files
# Or even more broadly for the main data dir:
# data/*
# !data/*.dvc # Keep .dvc files in the root of data/
# !data/ingested/ # And then re-specify for subdirs if needed
# !data/ingested/*.dvc

# For the src/data/ingested files too
